Hello! I'm Mrs Putlovski! I have a problem. I think my husband(Mr Putlovski) is cheating on me but I can't prove it. Hence I beg
you to help me. My husband keeps his email address and its password in the deeps of the program called PasswordKeeper. There is a set of
security levels. I know that an email of my husband has a ordinary name. Perhaps, it consists of his last name or the first name and some others words. But I'm not sure.
Please, get an access to his mail and look for some useful information in the drafts.


  Mrs Putlovski
